## ⚠️ Important Note

ShiftLog supports the ability to define aliases for sections,
and for the application itself.

For example, it is possible to rename the application to
"Graffiti Tracking" and the "Work Orders" section
to something like "Incident Reports".

The documentation uses the default names for each section:

- Work Orders
- Shifts
- Timesheets

ShiftLog also supports the ability to disable sections entirely.
It may be possible that "Timesheets" are not included in your installation.
