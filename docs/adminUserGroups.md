# User Group Management

User Groups allow you to organize users into logical groups for more granular permissions.

For example:

- If a work order type has a user group associated with it,
  only users that are part of that user group can access those work orders.

- If a piece of equipment has a user group associated with it,
  only users that are part of that user group can **add** the equipment to
  their records.
