Although the system is quite niche, it's being released in an open source
environment in hopes to pool developer resources from other municipalities
looking to move away from older, legacy systems or complicated spreadsheets.

It is being shared to start the dialog among other municipalities and present
an option to those who may be outgrowing managing tasks in spreadsheets
and looking for a more robust alternative.
